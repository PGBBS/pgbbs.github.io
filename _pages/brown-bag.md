title: "Brown Bag Seminar"
layout: page
---

We meet every week during the lecture time for some sandwiches and
apfelschorle -- and discuss topics on our nerdy minds. The default
date is :

    Thursday afternoon, ~18:00

Every session is led by a "Master of Ceremony" (MOC), lasts for
roughly an hour, is usually accompanied by some food (hence the name
of the seminar). There's also always a -- more or less voluntary --
scribe who takes notes in the form of a simple markdown-file which
then turn into evolving blogposts as below

# Topic/Format Incubator

TODO
- Does it make sense to have a SCRUM-like "What I learned last week
  and what I'll do next week" at the beginning of each session? -- Or
  have a (joint) Lerntagebuch?
- implement topic up/down-voting here?

## Selected Topics
that at least one of us would like to know/talk about

- Recommender Systems (Manu)
- App-Programmierung
- Tor and the Dark Web (https and .onion; Konstantin), see the talk at 32c3
- public key cryptography (Konstantin, see `_drafts`)
- Tests of (Artificial) Intelligence (e.g. in the context of
  psychology, AI in computer games)
- Presentation of a single recent (landmark) paper/result

Or the (ongoing) classic
- Schreibwerkstatt?

## Classic Papers
that every computer scientist should have read

- Harry Lewis has drafted a course
[Classics of Computer Science](https://harry-lewis.blogspot.de/2016/12/classics-of-computer-science.html?m=0)
with 25 lectures (a 90 min.) around papers taken from this
[master list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wS6O7-ZoFL7Cfjgt-kdhYxfg0qHdXyzpjJxikiqNPZg/edit#gid=65049622).
- Barbara Liskov gave the following
["must-read" list](http://jpirker.com/hlf16-liskovs-reading-list-for-computer-scientists/)
at the 16th Heidelberg Laureate Forum.
- There's also the [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/)
repository.

## Reading Group
(a classic format)

work together through a book/lecture notes (best with lectures);
usually requires weekly reading assignmests

## MOOC

from coursera.org
- Neural Networks by Geoffrey Hinton
- Probabilistic Graphical Models by Daphne Koller
- That "Paper Writing in the Sciences Course" from the medical
  sciences

Selection Criteria
- topic
- with (graded) exercises
- with accompanying book

## Rehearsal Talk
(Probevortrag)

Before giving a presentation at a workshop/conference, here's the
place and time to practice it and get some feedback.

## round table/orientation meeting

TODO
- maybe we should do this regularly on the first meeting of each semester?

elevator pitch
- everybody: 5 min's on his/her topic "Hallo, ich bin der <name>. Ich
  mach' <topic>, d.h. <explanation>. Und da bin I dahoam."

if we do more, then we should provide feedback:
- everybody: feedback in the form of "Thanks for your interesting
  talk ...
  - ... One point that really caught my attention was:" (dig deeper)
 or
 - ... We should really write a paper about:" (joint paper title)
