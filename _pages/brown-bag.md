We meet every week for some sandwiches and apfelschorle -- and discuss
topics on our nerdy minds. The default date is :

    Thursday afternoon, ~18:00

Every session lasts for about an hour and is led by a "Master of
Ceremony" (MOC). There's also always a -- more or less voluntary --
scribe who takes notes in the form of a simple markdown-file which
then turns up as a blogpost as below
