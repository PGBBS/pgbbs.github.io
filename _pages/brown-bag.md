title: "Brown Bag Seminar"
layout: page
---

We meet every week during the lecture time for some sandwiches and
apfelschorle -- and discuss topics on our nerdy minds. The default
date is :

    Thursday afternoon, ~18:00

Every session lasts for roughly an hour and is led by a "Master of
Ceremony" (MOC). There's also always a -- more or less voluntary --
scribe who takes notes in the form of a simple markdown-file which
then turns up as a blogpost as below

## trial presentation (Probevortrag)

Before giving a presentation at a workshop/conference, here's the
place and time to practice it and get some feedback.

## round table/elevator pitch

- everybody: 5 min's on his/her topic
- everybody: feedback in the form of "Thanks for your interesting
  talk ...
  - ... One point that really caught my attention was:" (dig deeper)
 or
 - ... We should really write a paper about:" (joint paper title)

 TODO maybe we should do this on the first meeting of each semester?
