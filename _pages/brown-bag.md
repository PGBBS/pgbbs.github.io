title: "Brown Bag Seminar"

---

We meet every week during the lecture time for some sandwiches and
apfelschorle -- and discuss topics on our nerdy minds. The default
date is :

    Thursday afternoon, ~18:00

Every session is led by a "Master of Ceremony" (MOC), lasts for
roughly an hour, is usually accompanied by some food (hence the name
of the seminar). There's also always a -- more or less voluntary --
scribe who takes notes in the form of a simple markdown-file which
then turn into evolving blogposts as below

## papers that every computer scientist should have read

Barbara Liskov gave the following ["must-read" list](http://jpirker.com/hlf16-liskovs-reading-list-for-computer-scientists/) at the 16th
Heidelberg Laureate Forum.




## trial presentation (Probevortrag)

Before giving a presentation at a workshop/conference, here's the
place and time to practice it and get some feedback.

## round table/elevator pitch

- everybody: 5 min's on his/her topic
- everybody: feedback in the form of "Thanks for your interesting
  talk ...
  - ... One point that really caught my attention was:" (dig deeper)
 or
 - ... We should really write a paper about:" (joint paper title)

 TODO maybe we should do this on the first meeting of each semester?
