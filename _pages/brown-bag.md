title: "Brown Bag Seminar"
layout: page
---

We meet every week on :

    Thursday afternoon, ~18:00

for some sandwiches and apfelschorle -- and discuss topics on our
nerdy minds. Every session is led by a "Master of Ceremony" (MOC),
lasts for roughly an hour, and is accompanied by some food (hence the
name of the seminar). During the last organizational meeting, we set
the following defaults:
- `ON` sessions take place (unless official holiday) unless canceled
  explicitly (usually, when less than 4 people would show up)
- `OPT-OUT` people are expected to show up or cancel by mail to the
  mailinglist (at least 24h before the session)
- `abstract` the MOC should send out a quick reminder/abstract the day
  before the session

By the way, the mailing-list is located at :

    pgbbs AT <domain-of-our-chair>

And finally, there's also always a -- more or less voluntary
-- scribe who takes notes in the form of a simple markdown-file which
then turn into evolving blogposts.

optimal team composition: carry (MOC), support (scribe),
jungler/assassin (advocatus diaboli -- that's a critic, not a pizza),
mid, top (one of them should lead the discussion and keep time; one of
them is next session's MOC -- TODO ask somebody with MMORPG experience
-- on the distinction; and also which role to skip if only 4 are
present; I guess that would be jungler for us)

# Topic/Format Incubator

TODO
- Does it make sense to have a SCRUM-like "What I learned last week
  and what I'll do next week" at the beginning of each session? -- Or
  have a (joint) Lerntagebuch?
- implement topic up/down-voting here?

## Selected Topics
that at least one of us would like to know/talk about

- Recommender Systems (Manu)
- App-Programmierung
- Tor and the Dark Web (https and .onion; Konstantin), see the talk at 32c3
- public key cryptography (Konstantin, see `_drafts`)
- Tests of (Artificial) Intelligence (e.g. in the context of
  psychology, AI in computer games)
- Presentation of a single recent (landmark) paper/result

Or the (ongoing) classic
- Schreibwerkstatt?

## Classic Papers
that every computer scientist should have read

- Harry Lewis has drafted a course
[Classics of Computer Science](https://harry-lewis.blogspot.de/2016/12/classics-of-computer-science.html?m=0)
with 25 lectures (a 90 min.) around papers taken from this
[master list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wS6O7-ZoFL7Cfjgt-kdhYxfg0qHdXyzpjJxikiqNPZg/edit#gid=65049622).
- Barbara Liskov gave the following
["must-read" list](http://jpirker.com/hlf16-liskovs-reading-list-for-computer-scientists/)
at the 16th Heidelberg Laureate Forum.
- There's also the [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/)
repository.

## Reading Group
(a classic format)

work together through a book/lecture notes (best with lectures);
usually requires weekly reading assignmests

## MOOC

from coursera.org
- Neural Networks by Geoffrey Hinton
- [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models) by Daphne Koller
- [Applied Social Network Analysis in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-social-network-analysis)
  by Daniel Romero
- [Social and Economic Networks: Models and Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-economic-networks)
  by Matthew O. Jackson
- [Writing in the Sciences](http://sciwrite.class.stanford.edu/) by Kristin Sainani

Selection Criteria
- topic
- with (graded) exercises
- with accompanying book

## Rehearsal Talk
(Probevortrag)

Before giving a presentation at a workshop/conference, here's the
place and time to practice it and get some feedback.

## round table/orientation meeting

TODO
- maybe we should do this regularly on the first meeting of each semester?

elevator pitch
- everybody: 5 min's on his/her topic "Hallo, ich bin der <name>. Ich
  mach' <topic>, d.h. <explanation>. Und da bin I dahoam."

if we do more, then we should provide feedback:
- everybody: feedback in the form of "Thanks for your interesting
  talk ...
  - ... One point that really caught my attention was:" (dig deeper)
 or
 - ... We should really write a paper about:" (joint paper title)
