title: "Brown Bag Seminar"
layout: page
---

We meet every week during the lecture time for some sandwiches and
apfelschorle -- and discuss topics on our nerdy minds. The default
date is :

    Thursday afternoon, ~18:00

Every session is led by a "Master of Ceremony" (MOC), lasts for
roughly an hour, is usually accompanied by some food (hence the name
of the seminar). There's also always a -- more or less voluntary --
scribe who takes notes in the form of a simple markdown-file which
then turn into evolving blogposts as below

# topic/format incubator

## things that at least one of us would like to know/talk about

- Recommender Systems (Manu)
- App-Programmierung
- Tor and the Dark Web (Konstantin)
- public key cryptography (Konstantin, see `_drafts`)
- Tests of (Artificial) Intelligence (e.g. in the context of
  psychology, AI in computer games)

## papers that every computer scientist should have read

Barbara Liskov gave the following ["must-read" list](http://jpirker.com/hlf16-liskovs-reading-list-for-computer-scientists/) at the 16th
Heidelberg Laureate Forum. There's also the
[Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) repository. Harry Lewis has
drafted a course [Classics of Computer
Science](https://harry-lewis.blogspot.de/2016/12/classics-of-computer-science.html?m=0)
with 25 lectures (a 90 min.) around papers taken from this [master
list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wS6O7-ZoFL7Cfjgt-kdhYxfg0qHdXyzpjJxikiqNPZg/edit#gid=65049622).

## trial presentation (Probevortrag)

Before giving a presentation at a workshop/conference, here's the
place and time to practice it and get some feedback.

## round table/elevator pitch

- everybody: 5 min's on his/her topic "Hallo, ich bin der <name>. Ich
  mach' <topic>, d.h. <explanation>. Und da bin I dahoam."

- everybody: feedback in the form of "Thanks for your interesting
  talk ...
  - ... One point that really caught my attention was:" (dig deeper)
 or
 - ... We should really write a paper about:" (joint paper title)

 TODO maybe we should do this on the first meeting of each semester?
 TODO Does it make sense to have a SCRUM-like "What I learned last week
 and what I'll do next week" at the beginning of each session? -- Or
 have a (joint) Lerntagebuch?
 TODO Schreibwerkstatt?
