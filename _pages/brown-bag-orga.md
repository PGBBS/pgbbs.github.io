We meet every week on :

    Thursday afternoon, ~18:00

for some sandwiches and apfelschorle -- and discuss topics on our
nerdy minds. Every session is led by a "Master of Ceremony" (MOC),
lasts for roughly an hour, and is accompanied by some food (hence the
name of the seminar). During the last organizational meeting, we set
the following defaults:
- `ON` sessions take place (unless official holiday) unless canceled
  explicitly (usually, when less than 4 people would show up)
- `OPT-OUT` people are expected to show up or cancel by mail to the
  mailinglist (at least 24h before the sessio)
- `abstract` the MOC should send out a quick reminder/abstract the day
  before the session

By the way, the mailing-list is located at :

    pgbbs AT <domain-of-our-chair>

And finally, there's also always a -- more or less voluntary
-- scribe who takes notes in the form of a simple markdown-file which
then turn into evolving blogposts.

And here's our [opening
theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJIa7hApF9o). :smile:

# Roles

- speaker (*carry*): prepare the session and give the presentation
- session-chair (*mid*): introduce the speaker, lead the discussion, and keep time
- breadwinner (*top*): choose a delivery service and collect food orders
- scribe (*support*): take notes (in markdown-format) and post/link them here
- reviewer (*jungler*): advocatus diaboli (that's a critic, not a
   pizza); also: review what the scribe wrote and prettify it with a
   nice Creative-Commons picture on top

While the speaker/topic is determined in a democratic discusison. The
other roles are determined by a 4-sided dice, i.e. a tetrahedron.

# Topic/Format Incubator

TODO
- Does it make sense to have a SCRUM-like "What I learned last week
  and what I'll do next week" at the beginning of each session? -- Or
  have a (joint) Lerntagebuch?
- implement topic up/down-voting here?

## Selected Topics
that at least one of us would like to know/talk about. This may be
technical or technological. In the spirit of Matt Might's
[Things that every computer science major should
know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/).

- Recommender Systems (Manu)
- App-Programmierung
- public key cryptography (Konstantin, see `_drafts`)
- Tests of (Artificial) Intelligence (e.g. in the context of
  psychology, AI in computer games)
- Presentation of a single recent (landmark) paper/result

Or the (ongoing) classic
- Schreibwerkstatt?

## Classic Papers
that every computer scientist should have read

- Harry Lewis has drafted a course
[Classics of Computer Science](https://harry-lewis.blogspot.de/2016/12/classics-of-computer-science.html?m=0)
with 25 lectures (a 90 min.) around papers taken from this
[master list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wS6O7-ZoFL7Cfjgt-kdhYxfg0qHdXyzpjJxikiqNPZg/edit#gid=65049622).
- Barbara Liskov gave the following
["must-read" list](http://jpirker.com/hlf16-liskovs-reading-list-for-computer-scientists/)
at the 16th Heidelberg Laureate Forum.
- There's also the [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/)
repository.

## Programming Pearls

Jon Bentley has a column http://bit.ly/2ikzqSE

## Reading Group
(a classic format)

work together through a book/lecture notes (best with lectures);
usually requires weekly reading assignmests

## MOOC

from coursera.org
- Neural Networks by Geoffrey Hinton
- [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models) by Daphne Koller
- [Applied Social Network Analysis in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-social-network-analysis)
  by Daniel Romero
- [Social and Economic Networks: Models and Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-economic-networks)
  by Matthew O. Jackson
- [Writing in the Sciences](http://sciwrite.class.stanford.edu/) by Kristin Sainani

Selection Criteria
- topic
- with (graded) exercises
- with accompanying book

## Rehearsal Talk (Probevortrag) and Paper Peer Review

- Before giving a presentation at a workshop/conference, here's the
  place and time to practice it and get some feedback.
- Also, before submitting your paper to a conference, you should let
  (some) of your colleagues peer-review it. Maybe (?) here's a place
  to discuss a paper with the author (once)? -- Or this better done
  one-on-one? On the other hand, this would be a format to get
  everybody's commitment/feedback. Maybe turn it into a speed-dating
  like paper-review?

## round table/orientation meeting

TODO
- maybe we should do this regularly on the first meeting of each semester?

elevator pitch
- everybody: 5 min's on his/her topic "Hallo, ich bin der <name>. Ich
  mach' <topic>, d.h. <explanation>. Und da bin I dahoam."

if we do more, then we should provide feedback:
- everybody: feedback in the form of "Thanks for your interesting
  talk ...
  - ... One point that really caught my attention was:" (dig deeper)
 or
 - ... We should really write a paper about:" (joint paper title)

## What else:

- LaserTag
- EscapeRoom
