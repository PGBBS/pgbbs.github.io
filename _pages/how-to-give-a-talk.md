# Use Case: Arbeitsgruppe (AG) DIMIS-MICS

Bachelor students give one talk (40'):
- final presentation at the end of their thesis
- content: topic, research question, methodology, results

Master's students give two talks:
- the first talk (20') at the beginning of your thesis work should
  contain
  - State of the Art
  - Central Idea
  - Work Schedule
  - this triggers the deadline (+6m)
- the second talk (40') should conclude your thesis work
  - present your results
  - first 3 min.: convince the audience about the relevance

In either case, post the abstract of your talk to the mailing
list ahead of time (at least 24 hours)
- in English
- in the mail body
- here's a rough [guideline](https://www.verywell.com/how-to-write-an-abstract-2794845)
