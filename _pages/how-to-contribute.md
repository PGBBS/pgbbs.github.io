Great! You're most welcome to contribute. Don't be shy, anything that
you consider even remotely relevant already has 1 (potential) reader.
:smile: Just get a quick 'n' dirty draft out quickly. Or edit somebody else's
quick 'n' dirty draft.

# Markup

We use Markdown as markup-language (with file-extension .md). Here's a
[cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can also use emojis -- at least the ones supported by Github's
Jekyll-plugin. Here's a list [TODO].

# Background

Jekyll differentiates between *posts* and *pages*. While the former
serve the role of blog posts (usually with timestamps), the latter can
be thought of as static (for example the "About"-page).
