# ITZ/IH

On the map, the ITZ is the building in the south, close to the sports

After a long and productive week you're hopefully looking
forward to a refreshing weekend in (and around) the Bavarian
forest. The University maintains a website with suggestions
for excursions (unfortunately in only German):

If you have a bike, then Schärding on the river Inn is an
attractive destination:

route to Schärding (or back or both), you may be tempted to
stop in Wernheim for some "cidre" at
