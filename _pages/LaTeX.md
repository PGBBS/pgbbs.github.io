# Install LaTeX

You will need LaTeX-distribution and an editor.

## LaTeX-distributions

For the former, the most popular is

- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (Linux, Windows) by
  the TeX User Group
- [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) (Mac OS) by the TeX User Group
- [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) (Windows only)



## LaTeX-editors

In theory, any text editor will do the job. In practice, you probably
want syntax highlighting and some IDE-functionality. Here are our top
recommendations:

- on Windows: [TeXStudio](http://www.texstudio.org) (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)
- on MacOS: [TeXPad](http://www.texpadapp.com) (Mac OS X)
- on Linux: Emacs with [AucTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/)

There are plenty of [alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors):
- [Lyx](http://www.lyx.org/) (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows); CONTRA:
  do you really need your own file format .lyx?!
- [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) (Linux, Mac OS X,
  Windows); CONTRA: seems to be superseded by TeXStudio

## Testing the installation

a minimal latex document contains :

    \documentclass{article}

    \begin{document}
    Hello world!
    \end{document}

Save the 5 lines above as `minimal.tex`, open it with the editor and compile.

# Write LaTeX

Armin Gerl has provided a template for the (German) master thesis
(based on the standard `report`-class):

- preview of the [pdf][1]
- all sources (and the pdf) in a [directory][2]

[1]:{{ site.url }}/docs/thesis-de-report/master-thesis-de.pdf
[2]:{{ site.repo }}/docs/thesis-de-report

Alternatively, Florian Stegmaier built template (based on the
KomaScript `scrreprt`-class):

- preview of the [pdf][3]
- all sources (and the pdf) in a [directory][4]

[3]:{{ site.url }}/docs/thesis-de-scrreprt/rootFile.pdf
[4]:{{ site.repo }}/docs/thesis-de-scrreprt

## Maintain your bibliography with BibTeX

- [german introduction](http://www.juergenfenn.de/tex/dtk/bibonline.pdf)
- [english
  introduction](http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/fenn/fenn.pdf)

A text editor is sufficient to maintain one's .bib-file, but if you
prefer some GUI (which might for example also link to the corresponding
pdf's), there's [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/).
