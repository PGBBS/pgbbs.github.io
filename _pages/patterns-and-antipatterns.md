The first half of the title refers to the influential "Design
Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". The second
half refers to "AntiPatterns: Refactoring Software, Architectures, and
Projects in Crisis". In either case, selected best-/worst-practices
in software architecture are examined. We present a digest.

# Antipatterns

## Not-invented-here syndrome
Poul-Henning Kamp in DOI:10.1145/2556647.2556655 with a nice overview
of :

    handbarrow (2 people) -- wheelbarrow (front wheel) -- Chinese wheelbarrow (center wheel)

He concludes with this beautiful caveat:
> Blindly deciding that IT be substituted for
> humans is unenlightenend. [...] The right thing to do is ask, as a
> Chinese engineer did 2,000 years ago, "If we're going to put a wheel
> on this thing, where is the best place to put it?" And to realize that
> two questions were asked.
