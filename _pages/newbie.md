1. Introduce yourself to the secretaries and ask where your (postal)
   mail will arrive. It is your responsibility to check it regularly.
2. Introduce yourself to your colleagues (with some cookies or
   cake). Some of the graduate students are organizing a
   reading/watching group or brown bag seminar. Talk to your
   colleagues if you want to join -- or initiate one.
3. Introduce yourself to the admin `admin@dimis.fim.uni-passau.de` who
   is your contact point for any hardware/software/IT-solutions.
   - Ask him to add your email to the chair's mailinglist
     `lehrstuhl@dimis.fim.uni-passau.de` or
     `mics@dimis.fim.uni-passau.de`, respectively.
   - Ask him to add your user to the `dimis`-group on LDAP to access
     all our file-/compute-servers.
4. Finally, Prof. Granitzer's group has a Jour Fixe meeting :

    on every monday, 12:00-14:00 @ZMK, 111a

See you there and welcome again. :smile:
