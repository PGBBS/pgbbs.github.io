#. Introduce yourself to the secretaries and ask where your (postal)
   mail will arrive. It is your responsibility to check it regularly.
#. Introduce yourself to your colleagues. Some of the graduate
   students are organizing a reading/watching group or brown bag
   seminar. Talk to your colleagues if you want to join -- or initiate
   one.
#. Introduce yourself to the admin `admin@dimis.fim.uni-passau.de` and
   ask him to be added to the chair's mailinglist. He/She is also your
   contact point for any hardware/software/IT-solutions that you may
   be looking for.
#. During lecture time there are two regular meetings that might apply
   to you.
