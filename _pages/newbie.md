1. Introduce yourself to the secretaries and ask where your (postal)
   mail will arrive. It is your responsibility to check it regularly.
2. Introduce yourself to your colleagues. Some of the graduate
   students are organizing a reading/watching group or brown bag
   seminar. Talk to your colleagues if you want to join -- or initiate
   one.
3. Introduce yourself to the admin `admin@dimis.fim.uni-passau.de` and
   ask him to be added to the chair's mailinglist. He/She is also your
   contact point for any hardware/software/IT-solutions that you may
   be looking for.
4. During lecture time there are two regular meetings that might apply
   to you.
