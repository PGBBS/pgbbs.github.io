this is on a language level, there are also how-tos on a paper level
or on a technical (LaTeX) level.

# Favourite Rules

As we have leared a lot by this paper of how to improve out english scientific writing, Konstantin suggested that everyone supports his or her favourite rule and why it is so favoured.

* Manu: "Picking a single rule as farvourite rule was hard for me (if i had to pick a single one, its number 7). As I am not leaned heavily towards _mathematical_ writing because of the field of application of my thesis, I was most inspired by the rules that concerned sentence structure and the "flow" of your writing. So a mixture of rules with the numbers 7, 9, 12, 17, and 24 is my choice, as they incite you to write in a technical fashion but also remind you to not forget that people are intended to read what you have written at the end - so keep them motivated as well! In combination, write rhythmic and good-to-read sentences that differ slightly in structure and thereby keep the reader hooked by writing good introductory sentences to your chapters and sections and keep them interested by indicating the awesome things that he or she is about to read."

# from George Orwell (1946), [Politics and the English Language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/)

Short and very readable easy on the (im)proper use of language. Applies to science as well as politics. Concludes with the following list of rules:

> i. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> ii. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> iii. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> iv. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> v. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> vi. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
