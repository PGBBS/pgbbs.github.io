# Use Case: Arbeitsgruppe (AG) DIMIS-MICS

Master's students have to give two talks:
- the first talk (20') at the beginning of your thesis work should
  contain
  - State of the Art
  - Central Idea
  - Work Schedule
- the second talk (40') should conclude your thesis work
  - first 3 min.: convince the audience about the relevance

In either case, post the abstract of your talk to the mailing
list ahead of time (at least 24 hours).
