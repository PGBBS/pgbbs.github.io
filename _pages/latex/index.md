## write your thesis

### Install LaTeX

You will need LaTeX-distribution and an editor.

For the former, the most popular is

- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (Linux, Windows) by
  the TeX User Group
- [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) (Mac OS) by the TeX User Group
- MiKTeX (Windows only)

For the latter, any text editor will do, but you might also want some
IDE-functionality

- [TeXStudio](http://www.texstudio.org) (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)
- [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) (Linux, Mac OS X,
  Windows)
- [TeXPad](http://www.texpadapp.com) (Mac OS X)
- ... and of course: Emacs with AucTeX

### Maintain your bibliography with BibTeX

- [german introduction](http://www.juergenfenn.de/tex/dtk/bibonline.pdf)
- [english
  introduction](http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/fenn/fenn.pdf)

A text editor is sufficient to maintain one's .bib-file, but if you
prefer some GUI (which might for example also link to the corresponding
pdf's), there's [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/).
