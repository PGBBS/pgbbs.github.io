## write your thesis

### Install LaTeX

You will need LaTeX-distribution and an editor.

For the former, the most popular is

- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)
- MiKTeX (Windows only)

For the latter, any text editor will do, but you might also want some
IDE-functionality

- [TeXStudio](http://www.texstudio.org) (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)
- [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) (Linux, Mac OS X,
  Windows)
- [TeXPad](http://www.texpadapp.com) (Mac OS X)
- ... and of course: Emacs with AucTeX
