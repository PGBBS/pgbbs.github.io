# Wishlist

- Search: jekyll plugins are generally disabled for github pages, so in
  particular the [search
  plugin](https://github.com/slashdotdash/jekyll-lunr-js-search/issues/82)

# Troubleshooting

If your page does not build, you'll receive an email-notification and
the content of the email is also displayed in the repository's Setting >
Options > GitHub Pages. Unfortunately, this is usually quite
uninformative. You may have to `bundle exec jekyll serve` for better
information through a local run.
