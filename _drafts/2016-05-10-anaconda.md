title: Setting up my Python environment
---

We choose
- 64-bit (over 32-bit) Python 3 (over Python 2), because the future is
  now.
- conda install and environments (over pip install and virtualenv), for
  better (ex)portability. (Conda's `environment.yml` seems more
  informative/explicit than virtualenv's `requirements.txt`.)

# Install Anaconda

1. Download and run the Anaconda installer from
http://www.continuum.io/downloads Note that the version number may be
confusing `Anaconda3-4.0.0-*` refers to the Python3 installation of Anaconda
v4.0.0 -- with default installation directory `anaconda3`. We shorten
this to `~/local/share/anaconda`:

    $ bash Anaconda3-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

2. Accept the Licencse agreement
3. OPT change installation directory
4. add the binary path to your $PATH

## Setup and Uninstallation

~/.condarc
: specifies the channels that are searched and other settings
~/.conda/
: contains `environments.txt` where the complete path of every newly
generated environment is appended; nevertheless, this does not seem to
be the location for look up of `conda info --evs`; ?what's the purpose?
~/.continuum/
: auto-generated and empty
~/.jupyter/
: configuration and hooks, e.g. autogenerating py- and html-versions

Thus, in order to uninstall anaconda delete these configuration
files/directories, `rm -rf` the installation directory, and remove the
binary from path.

You also can *not* move the anaconda-directory, because absolute paths
are set during the installation.

## Package management

In anaconda, the intention is to distribute packages (libraries) through channels.
By default, there is one channel which hosts around 400 packages. The
anaconda meta-package picks around 150 of them. See
https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs#python-3-5 for a current
list.

packages/libraries are distributed through channels

Now, we have the following terminology
- anaconda is the name of the distribution *and* also the name of its
  largest (meta-)package
- conda is the name of the package/environment manager
- miniconda is conda bundled with only the python-package (instead of
  the anaconda-metapackage)


# Add channels/packages/environments

installing a new environment requires
- a name
- a list of packages to start with,
  - absolutely minimal in a sense would be `python` (if you don't want python, why use
    anaconda?):

$ conda create -n test python

  - the minimum that we go with at the moment is the `anaconda`
    meta-package:

$ conda create -n test anaconda

Later, you may want to consider specifying the minimal/defaults for new
channels in `.condarc`, like

create_default_packages:
  - ipython

you cannot rename an environment, but you can clone it and delete the
old one

you delete an environment by:

$ conda remove -n test --all


## additional packages

may come from other channels

By default, conda install --channel asmeurer <package> is the same as
conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/asmeurer <package>.
This is because the default channel_alias is https://conda.anaconda.org/
. Whenever conda is given a channel name that is not a URL, it prepends
the channel_alias to the front of the name it was given.

or may be pip-installed; if you use anaconda's pip, then they are both
tracked by the environment and the list (of conda- *and* pip-packages) can be exported as:

    $ conda env export > environment.yml

Continuum hosts many more packages (beyond python ) at
https://repo.continuum.io/

pip is for python packages only and taps into the huge Pypi-archive;
many of these packages now come with wheels, so don't have to be built
from scratch on installation

conda is meant for the complete software stack (possibly including
C-libraries, R-packages, database-systems, test-suites, etc.; HDF5, MKL,
LLVM); for additional packages you have to skeleton, build, install
(with a recipe) and may then host it on your channel





## install/update version policy

Conda tries to find the combination of packages with the highest version
number that works together (using a SAT-solver!):

	$ conda update --all

is the straightforward way for all installed packages, but may lead to
an inconsistent environment, e.g. if you update packages in the
anaconda-metapackage beyond the version specified by anaconda. You can
resolve this by removing the meta-package (does will not change any
actual packages):

	$ conda remove conda

If you can be more patient and wait till the versions in the
anaconda-package have been updated (and well tested together), you
better refrain from `conda update --all` and just go for `conda update
anaconda` (my choice).

when installing/updating a package, the preference is the highest
version (among all channels, without any particular order) which does
not require any downgrading of existing (depending) packages. This
version will be installed and all dependent packages will be updated.
Here's the quote from the man-page

<q
Conda attempts to install the newest versions of the requested packages.
To
accomplish this, it may update some packages that are already installed,
or
install additional packages. To prevent existing packages from updating,
use the --no-update-deps option. This may force conda to install older
versions of the requested packages, and it does not prevent additional
dependency packages from being installed.

## Example environment `tensorflow`

from
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#anaconda-installation

an environment with merely python is sufficient, but we add at least the
basic anaconda packages
$ conda create -n tensorflow anaconda

$ source activate tensorflow

for starters, the CPU-only version is sufficient
(tensorflow)$ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl

There's a problem with the filename (!) of the python wheel -- since it
is quite specific about the python version (3.4) and the python ABI
(cp34m) and our anaconda is more current (python version 3.5 and we
intend to keep it that way). The workaround is to download and rename:

$ wget
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
-O tensorflow-0.8.0-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl
$ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-0.8.0-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl


See PEP 425+427 for details on Python wheels (the evolution of eggs).

## Example environment Gensim

for word2vec/doc2vec

## Example environment `medic`

$ conda create -n medic -c r r-essentials rpy2 anaconda pip numpy
scipy pandas

For survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen

$ pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines.git

# Clean/Purge:

	$ conda clean -t    # remove downloaded tarballs
	$ conda clean -p    # remove packages that are not hardlinked
	$ conda clean -a    # all

# PyCharm integration

Configure > Settings > Python Interpreters > add
`$HOME/local/share/bin/python`

the binary `charm` is installed to `/usr/local/bin/`

TODO GPU-enabled version, requiring CUDA toolkit 7.5 and CuDNN v4.
