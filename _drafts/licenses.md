Examples for CC-license

http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution

and how to mention the source, when you modify them (i.e. generate
derivative work)

An example that I saw as image-caption:
<Title> (CC BY-SA 2.0 (linked to license) by <author> (linked to
source on flickr))

# VG Wort et al

In Germany, there used to be a "Rahmenvertrag for Paragraph 52a UrhG"
dealing with the re-use of copy-righted material for educational
purposes. You can ignore all these commercial and legal shenanigans by
choosing material from the Public Domain, Creative Commons, and Open
Access. Do it!
