# Software

At the top of my head, my first choice is GPLv2 omitting the clause "and later
versions" (like the Linux kernel, because the GPLv3 seems like a real
SNAFU).

Some people opt for the/an (?) Apache License, because it's suppossed to
be better compatible with commercial interests. (Source?) Question:
which is better compatible with scientific interests?

# Text and Images

For text (documentation), we use CC BY-SA, like wikipedia. (Stay away from the GNU FDL,
because the invariant-clause is non-free and the DRM-clause is badly
written.)

Examples for CC-license

http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution

and how to mention the source, when you modify them (i.e. generate
derivative work)

An example that I saw as image-caption:
<Title> (CC BY-SA 2.0 (linked to license) by <author> (linked to
source on flickr))

## VG Wort et al

In Germany, there used to be a "Rahmenvertrag for Paragraph 52a UrhG"
dealing with the re-use of copy-righted material for educational
purposes. You can ignore all these commercial and legal shenanigans by
choosing material from the Public Domain, Creative Commons, and Open
Access. Do it!

The U.S. Department of State has issued an
[Open Licensing Playbook](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/01/267125.htm)
(under CC0-license!) for recommendations ("plays") on publishing
grant-supported material, especially educational. (Source:
