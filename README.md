# PGBBS: Passau Graduate Student Brown Bag Seminar

Manu & Konstantin decided to accompany our graduate student seminar
with a blog at [https://pgbbs.github.io/](https://pgbbs.github.io). It
is built as github-page with Jekyll from the sources in
[this repository](https://github.com/PGBBS/pgbbs.github.io).

publication of our employer or the university. The views and advice
presented here are therefore completely nonbinding -- in any
