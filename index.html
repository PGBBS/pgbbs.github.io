  Welcome to this collection of bits and pieces by some (not so
  random) Passau Graduate Students. They are technically built from a
  github-repository using Jekyll. And they are philosophically founded
  as a [do-ocracy](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/DoOcracy): if you
  think something should be on these pages, put it here. If you see
  something that could be improved, do it. (The whole thing is
  version-controlled.)

  On the one hand, there are (very) rough notes on
  topics that we discuss while simultaneously enjoying a meal (see
  "Posts" below). On the other hand, there's general
  information that we refer to (and are asked for) regularly (see
  "Pages" below).

  <h1 class="page-heading">Posts</h1>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <h1 class="page-heading">Pages</h1>

  <ul class="pages-list">
    {% for page in site.pages %}
    <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="pages-link" href="{{ page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
        </h2>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a></p>
