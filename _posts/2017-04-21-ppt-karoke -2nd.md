# Setup

Today our PGGBS round featured another round of powerpoint karaoke.
Each member prepared a presentation for about 10 minutes.
The dice decided the distribution of the talks among the speakers.

# Program
We had the following expert talks in our round:

- Armin: Branding - 10 do's and don'ts
- Thomas: What's the matter with tomatoes sold in Bosten?
- Manu: Fascination of Physics
- Konstanting: Epic HowTo - Make money playing video games!

The speakers demonstrated expert knowledge in their respective fields. The audience was stunned by the topics.

# Social Event
To round our session a game of activity has been started which has also been attended by the audience.

The line-up for the teams has been:

 - Team 1: Armin and Steffi
 - Team 2: Manu, Thomas and Matthias

The two teams have been fighting hard for the victory.
One Expression after another has been described, painted or mimiced from each team.

Eventually Team 2 has won the game.
