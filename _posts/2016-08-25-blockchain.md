# Theoretical Background: Proof of Work

- [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system),
  suggested by [Dwork & Naor
  (1993)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=705669), e.g. hashcash
  (compute 2nd pre-image on SHA256^2) or Ethash
- original [Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) by Satoshi
  Nakamoto (2008)

## Application: Hashcash

idea: user needs to show some work to use a service

# Blockchain

key features
- log (aka ledger, dt. "Kassenbuch"), i.e. records over time
- immutable
- distributed
- "trustless", i.e. w/o trusted third party
