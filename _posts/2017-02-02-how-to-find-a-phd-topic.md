## How to Kick this off?

Don't start with trying to pinpoint your topic in the vast scientfic world. The task of "finding a thesis" may seem overwhelming at first. Start by working on smaller problems. Problems which may concern active researchers of your faculty, students or external organisations. Or problems originating from results of your bachelors or master thesis. Even if they seem random or insignificant, working on individual problems can give you an insight into the different fields and the nature of the scientific environment of your university. Try finding solutions and give talks about them to collaborators or colleagues. If you really publish a paper about those problems isn't the main concern. You need to grow accustomed to the process of scientific work and selfreflect on your quirks and preferences.
The most important step to finding a topic is maybe to find yourself and your intrest by reading current scientific contributions and talking as well as listening to every researcher you can get a hold of.

## Basic Aspects supporting your Topic

- Feasability
- Environment
- Scientific methods

## Brainstorm

- Industry Partner (Lessons Learned)
- Intrests of the  Supervisor
- Buzzwords or Hot Topics
- Published Works in current Conference
- Topic in a highly occupied area (big players) or in a more specific sparsely researched topic
- Reading other dissertations
- Financial Support (follow-up projects?)
- competitors?
