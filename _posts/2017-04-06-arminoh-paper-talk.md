"I accept all terms and conditions! ALWAYS!")

# "I accept all terms and conditions! ALWAYS!"

Today, our colleague Armin held an interesting talk about his soon to be paper about issues in the fields of privacy. He explained what Privacy Preserving Languages PL are and added the claim, that the classic representatives lack some qualities.

His answer to this problem is the introduction of a new class of PLs: Layered Privacy Languages. Next to this, he also proposes a new language of this type.

For those who are interested to get a detailed view about Armin's work and this topic, stay tuned for his upcoming paper(s)!
