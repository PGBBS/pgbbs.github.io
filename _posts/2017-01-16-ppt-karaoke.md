# Powerpoint Karaoke

Hat tip to Christin for introducing/organizing several of these for
MICS. Here are some guidelines

## pick sildes
- ~10 slides
- any topic *except* for computer science (yes, these exist)
- informative (preferably high information density, but not full of
  formulas)

## get slides at random and present
- 10 min
- be convincing, confident and credible
- be serious, yet enthusiastic
- interact with audience
- have transitions between the slides
- check language quality/fluency/expression/speed
- check non-verbal expressions/body language
- deliver the key points
- stand your ground in the Q&A

## receive feedback
after every presentation, commenting on the points above
