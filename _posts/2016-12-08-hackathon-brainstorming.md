# Tech-Support for "Das Schwarze Auge" (our favorite Pen-and-Paper)
- DSA1 (low-effort): provide collab drawing tools for the whole group
  a la http://twiddla.com, i.e. also web-based; features: integrated
  spider/monster stamp, incl. pets
- DSA2 (high-effort): provide an opp for the master; xml-parsing is
  not so exciting; features: supply xml to master and master can
  easily quickly query for talents, this will be a website, need
  database; helden-software produces xml-output, Sinnesschaerfe,
  Zwergennase, Orientierung; One button "Sinnessschaerfe" for easy
  parallel querying the group; make battles semi-automatic
- DSA3: wiki & rule-book-app
- DSA3.5: photo-app with OCR and graph-export (see Evernote); maybe
  start small with a plug-in for the collab drawing tool above?

# Neural Network on real-world data
- neuronale Bauern-Regel: enable weather-cam; collect images; define
  features (Tag/Nacht; Gutes/Schlechtes Wetter); use a convolutional
  neural network; there's a famous library
- general IOT idea: attach public wetter-station to ITZ
- somebody built a coffee-machine-detector from a cheap webcam with
  motion/audio-detection (Privacy FTW?)

# AI on digital data
- HackaWhat: crawl twitter/heise for "trending topics" for next year's
  hackathon; heatmap/word-cloud for scientific buzzwords/open-source
  technology in our publications (incl. Master thesis)
- Bot for Hearthstone, Super-Mario or some turn-based strategy game;
  for a single-day-project, maybe start with noughts-and-crosses

# Wikipedia Plug-In for pdf-artifacts
- PassRDF: input: pdf with image and (machine-readable) text and
  word-document with structured description. Cany you, e.g. query
  wikipedia to a) check the description for plagariasm and b) suggest
  additional information (e.g. birthdates) via access to wikipedia?
  (1st todo: ask Manu about RDF.)

# Hardware-Hacking
- Andy: Ambifree: Ambilight for everyone (hardware cost ~100 Euro :-( ));
  colored HDMI-strips on TV for better immersion!
- Armin: USB-turret Nerf-gun targeting  (expensive hardware)
- Manu: lehrstuhlweite Blink-Kommunikation
- amphibious robots for the workshop at Lake Chiemsee

# Miscellaneous
- Max: (visual?) feeback for speakers of talks concerning the audio
  quality; e.g. blink-USB at the back of the room indicating when
  things get unintelligible
- Manu: speech-recognizer; what is state-of-the-art? what is the gap
  to instant reaction?
