"Egghunts - Different Perspectives")

Today was a little bit different than the usual PGBBS seminar. Instead of sitting there, having food while someone is pondering about interesting things, we had to go out there into the wilderness and find our food first!

Steffi prepared a classic easter egghunt for us, which lead us tracking down various kinds of sweets scattered over the whole campus of the University of Passau. Therefore, she used the app [Actionbound](https://en.actionbound.com/), which helps you to create the egghunt with various technical details, like QR code scanning, taking photos that have to match a location, and so on. As a result, your handy will be the guide through the hunt, which is perfectly fitting for tech guys like us!

It was a lot of fun, big thanks again to Steffi!
