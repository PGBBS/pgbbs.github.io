- Web of People / Web of Data / Web of Things
- Linked Data
- Semantic Web

Influences, enabling, affecting, containing, using each other?

# Early Vision

Motivation of Tim Berners Lee with a little story.

Example: Lucy and Pete

Management Task (With a lot of factors):

- Where do I get the stuff
- What do I need
- Where do I get the information
- Rating of peers?
- Timing schedule matching

How to solve this in the web?
A lot of information is in the web reachable - but it can be hard to find the right information. Look at the semantic point of views of a task.

We need a Semantic Agent who can work with Semantic Queries.
The agent needs a adjustment process to evaluate results and weight different decisions.

# Web of Data (Web 3.0)

Web of Documents (Web 1.0, Web 2.0) for humans. Just browsing HTML stuff and reading.

Web 3.0 should make data machine readable and understandable.

## Documents vs Data

Content negotiation: Link the Client with a viable representation.

- Human -> HTML
- Semantic Agent -> RDF

## RDF

Information Represenation / transport of information with a clear and flexible language.

Bob and Cesar example.

Graph versus Triples

Exploration of data by integrating multiple data bases.

Type information of nodes / resources.

## RDF Ontologies

To solve the task of ambiguity and the DRY principle

# Where did it go wrong?

- Nobody knows the killer app for Semantic Web
- Everyone is implementing own Ontologies
- Nobody wants to pay for mapping his data if there is no instant benefit
