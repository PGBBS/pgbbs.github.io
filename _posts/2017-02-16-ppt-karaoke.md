Hat tip to Christin for introducing/organizing several of these for
MICS. Here are some guidelines

## prepare/pick sildes
- content should fit within 10 minutes (for beginners, this means 10 slides)
- file format is pdf (yes, powerpoint has great animations, but we aim for a
  great talk)
- any topic *except* for computer science or mathematics (yes, these exist)
- slides should be informative (preferably high information density, but not full of
  formulas)
- OPTIONAL title should give the speaker a hint -- or not

## distribute slides
- put them in our dropbox/syncthing-folder (if you have no access,
  then write a nice email to the postdoc geographically closest to
  you)
- rename your file as `[number].pdf`, where `[number]` is the number
  of files in the folder (including yours)
- don't look at the other files in the folder

## get slides at random and present
- for 10 min (strict limit)
- be convincing, confident and credible
- be serious, yet enthusiastic
- interact with audience
- have transitions between the slides
- check language quality/fluency/expression/speed
- check non-verbal expressions/body language
- deliver the key points
- stand your ground in the Q&A

## receive feedback
- the audience will provide feedback w.r.t. the points above after
  every presentation. Appreciate it.

## Feedback rules:
- use the feedback sandwich: start with something positive, then something negative, end with something positive
- goal is to eleminate [blind spots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window "Johari Window Wikipedia")
- An inherant property of feedback is that it can be given, but it need not be accepted. For the giver: Say what you think would be helpful for the other person, what is changeable. For the receiver: Take what you need and leave the rest. Be thankful for the effort the giver made.
- Use "I"-phrases to indicate your subjective perception of the speaker. E.g. "For me the speed of the presentation was too fast." NOT "You talk to fast."
